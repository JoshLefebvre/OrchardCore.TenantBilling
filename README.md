# OrchardCore.TenantBilling
An Orchard Core module to keep track of multi tenant SaaS payments and billing.

- This module is not meant to actually process any payments, rather it is meant to be used in conjuction with other extension modules for actual payment:
    - Stripe: https://github.com/JoshLefebvre/OrchardCore.StripePayment   
- The goal of this module is to handle generic information related to a customer's monthly billing cycle (subscription based)
- This module is still in early stages of development and is not ready for consumption.
